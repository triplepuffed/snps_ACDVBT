#Language: bash script. First create a file such as script.sh and paste this code in the file, 
# exit the file, and run it on the command line.
#Function: To automatically sort through SNPs with FST = 1 (SNP of interest) to search up how many flanking SNPs 
#are around the SNP of interest, what the depth for flanking positions are, and whether if there is enough flanking 
sequences around the SNP of interest to make it a good TaqMan assay candidate.
#Input files: 3 text files: 
#   1) chromosome_auto.txt: chromosome number of each SNP (eg. NC_036850.1)
#   2) position_auto.txt: position number of each SNP (eg. 600000)
#   3) snpname_auto.txt: identifier for your SNPs (eg. ACDV50_6, BTDV72_8)
#   Note: if you are looking through 5 SNPs, there should be 5 lines total for each of these files

#Output: 
#   1) A counter text called snpsresults.txt that calculates how many SNPs are within 30 bp upstream and downstream of your SNP of interest.
#      for example the output may look like (ACDV50_6 = 0, BTDV72_8 = 5 which means ACDV50_6 has no SNPs and 
#      BTDV72_8 has 5 within 30 bp upstream and downstream).
#   2) The 1000SNPs.....vcf file that contains 1000 bp total (500 upstream and 500 downstream flanking your SNP of interest) 
#      comparison against reference genome and other sequencing statistics
#   3) .ldepth file which shows the depth of SNPs surrounding the SNP of interest. 
#   4) .log file which reports the command that was done.
